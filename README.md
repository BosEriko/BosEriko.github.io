Hello! My name is Bos Eriko Reyes and I'm a front-end website developer/designer based on the Philippines. I've been creating websites for over three years now. It started out as a hobby but as time goes by I soon noticed that there is a lot of things to learn regarding the field. Fast forward to the present and I am now capable of creating websites from scratch that businesses and individuals can use.

I'm comfortable when it comes to HTML and CSS and I can also use jQuery. I mainly use bootstrap to make my websites responsive. I can use WordPress and uCoz as a back-end of a website but I can be flexible and learn new things depending on what the client asks me to do. I am also capable of working in a team by means of Github, well-documented codes and great communication skills.

I am not limited to front-end, though. I know how to use Python, AngularJS, C++ and Java. My knowledge on them may not be as good as my knowledge on front-end but I'm not going to let it end there. I love fixing bugs and adding new features to programs to make it better. I'm also reading more about the languages that I've mentioned above every day to not let my knowledge on programming burn out because there's a lot to learn.

In summary, I am a front-end website developer/designer who wants to be better on programming. If you're interested in hiring me, you can do so by going to my website.
